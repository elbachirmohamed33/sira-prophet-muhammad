                <h3>üó°Ô∏è The Plot of Dar al-Nadwa - The Night of Assassination</h3>
                <p>
                    On the night of 26 Safar in the first year of Hijra (622 CE), the Quraysh gathered at Dar al-Nadwa to devise a final plan to eliminate Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫. The meeting was attended by leaders from all Quraysh tribes, and after lengthy consultations, Abu Jahl proposed a cunning plan: to select a strong young man from each tribe to strike the Prophet Ô∑∫ with one blow, thus scattering his blood among the tribes so that Banu Hashim could not fight all of Quraysh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Quraysh agreed to this vile plan and selected eleven men from among the nobles of Quraysh, including: Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, Abu Lahab, Al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As, Al-Aqra ibn Habis, Zam'a ibn al-Aswad, Tu'aima ibn Adi, Abu al-Bakhtari, Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid, Manbah and Nabih the sons of al-Hajjaj, and Umayya ibn Khalaf.

                <h3>üë§ Ali Sleeps in the Prophet's Ô∑∫ Bed</h3>
                <p>
                    When Angel Jibril Ô∑∫ informed Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ of the Quraysh plot, Allah commanded him not to sleep in his bed that night. The Prophet Ô∑∫ then asked his cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib Ô∑∫ to sleep in his bed and cover himself with his green Hadhrami cloak. He told him: "Sleep in my bed and wrap yourself in this green Hadhrami cloak, sleep in it, for nothing harmful will reach you from them."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ali Ô∑∫ courageously accepted this dangerous mission, knowing he could be killed. When the polytheists came and stood at the door waiting, Ali was sleeping in the Prophet's Ô∑∫ bed covered with his cloak, and they thought the Prophet Ô∑∫ was sleeping in his bed.

                <h3>üåô The Prophet's Ô∑∫ Exit from Among the Besiegers</h3>
                <p>
                    On that blessed night, Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ left his house while the polytheists surrounded it, and Allah blinded them so they could not see him. The Prophet Ô∑∫ took a handful of dust and threw it on their heads while reciting Allah's words: "And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the Prophet Ô∑∫ went to the house of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq Ô∑∫ at an unusual time. When Abu Bakr saw him, he said: "What brings you, O Messenger of Allah, at this hour?" The Prophet Ô∑∫ said: "Have your people leave." Abu Bakr said: "They are only your family, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah." He said: "Allah has given me permission to leave and migrate." Abu Bakr said: "Companionship, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah." The Prophet Ô∑∫ said: "Companionship."

                <h3>üï≥Ô∏è In the Cave of Thawr - Three Blessed Nights</h3>
                <p>
                    Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr headed to the cave of Thawr on Mount Thawr south of Mecca, in the opposite direction from the Medina route, to mislead the pursuers. They reached the cave at night, Abu Bakr entered first to ensure the safety of the place, then the Prophet Ô∑∫ entered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the cave, many miracles occurred demonstrating Allah's protection of His messenger Ô∑∫. A spider wove its web at the cave entrance in a short time, and pigeons came to lay eggs at the entrance, making the pursuers think that no one had entered the cave for a long time.

                <p>
                    When the Quraysh discovered that the Prophet Ô∑∫ had escaped, they announced a reward of one hundred camels for whoever brought them back alive or dead. Pursuers spread out on all roads leading to Medina, and some came right to the cave door, but Allah turned them away from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the pursuers was Suraqa ibn Malik al-Mudliji, who coveted the reward and followed them on his horse. But every time he approached them, his horse's legs sank into the ground, until he understood this was Allah's command, so he asked them for safety and promised to turn people away from them.

                    After three nights in the cave, Abdullah ibn Urayqit brought them the camels at their appointed time. They left the cave by an unusual path, heading toward the coast then east toward Medina, avoiding the usual routes monitored by Quraysh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They took a difficult route along the western coast, passing by places like that of Umm Ma'bad, where the miracle of the goat occurred - it gave milk after being lean and milkless, when the Prophet Ô∑∫ touched its udder and invoked Allah.

                <h3>üåÖ Arrival at Medina the Illuminated</h3>
                <p>
                    On Monday, 12 Rabi' al-Awwal of the first year of Hijra (September 24, 622 CE), Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ arrived at Medina the Illuminated. The people of Medina had been eagerly awaiting him, and when they saw him, they celebrated and came out to welcome him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ first stopped at Quba at Kulthum ibn al-Hadm's place, staying there four days during which he built the Quba Mosque, the first mosque built in Islam. Then he entered Medina on Friday, and prayed Friday in the valley with the Muslims.

                <h3>üìÖ The Beginning of Islamic History</h3>
                <p>
                    With the blessed prophetic Hijra, official Islamic history began. Muslims took this great event as the beginning of the Hijri calendar, recognizing its importance in Islamic history. It was not merely a geographical move, but a complete civilizational and spiritual transformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hijra taught Muslims that jihad in Allah's path includes sacrificing homeland, family, and wealth for religion, and that Allah helps those who help Him regardless of difficult circumstances. It also showed the importance of planning and taking means while relying on Allah.
