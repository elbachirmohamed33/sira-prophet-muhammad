                <h3>üêò The Year of the Elephant (570 CE)</h3>
                <p>
                    Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫ was born in the blessed year known as "Am al-Fil" (The Year of the Elephant) in 570 CE, in the holy city of Mecca. This year gained its name from the famous incident when Abraha, the Abyssinian ruler of Yemen, attempted to attack the sacred Kaaba with a massive army that included war elephants. However, Allah protected His sacred house by sending flocks of birds (Ababil) that pelted Abraha's army with stones of baked clay, destroying them completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ was born on Monday, the 12th of Rabi' al-Awwal, in the house of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, in the Banu Hashim quarter of Mecca. His birth was accompanied by miraculous signs: his mother Aminah reported that a light emanated from her that illuminated the palaces of Syria, and she felt no pain during childbirth. When he was born, he was already circumcised, with his umbilical cord cut, prostrating with his face towards the Kaaba.

                <p>
                    Muhammad Ô∑∫ belonged to the noblest lineage among the Arabs. His father was Abdullah ibn Abdul Muttalib, known for his exceptional beauty and righteousness. His mother was Aminah bint Wahb, from the respected Banu Zuhra tribe. His lineage traces back through the purest Arab bloodlines to Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), peace be upon them both.

                <h3>üò¢ Early Orphanhood</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet's father Abdullah had died before his birth, while returning from a trading journey to Syria. He fell ill in Yathrib (later Medina) and died there, leaving behind his pregnant wife and some modest possessions. Thus, Muhammad Ô∑∫ was born an orphan, which was part of Allah's wisdom in preparing him for his future mission as a messenger to all of humanity, including the orphaned and underprivileged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His mother Aminah raised him with tremendous love and care for the first six years of his life. She would tell him about his noble father and the signs that accompanied his birth. Despite being an orphan, the child Muhammad was blessed with exceptional qualities that made everyone who saw him love him. His grandfather Abdul Muttalib, the leader of Mecca, took special care of him and would say: "This son of mine will have a great future."
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>ü§± Nursing with Halima Sa'diyya</h3>
                <p>
                    Following Arab custom, baby Muhammad was given to a Bedouin wet nurse to be raised in the desert, which was considered healthier for children and would help them develop eloquent Arabic speech. Initially, the Bedouin women were reluctant to take an orphan, preferring children whose fathers could pay them well. However, Halima bint Abi Dhuayb from the Sa'd ibn Bakr tribe, who had found no other child, decided to take Muhammad Ô∑∫.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the moment Halima took Muhammad Ô∑∫, her life was filled with blessings (barakah). Her previously dry breast began flowing with milk, her weak camel became strong and fast, and her flocks grew healthy and productive. She kept him for more than two years, and during this time, her family experienced unprecedented prosperity. Even after weaning, she was reluctant to return him, asking his mother to let her keep him longer due to the blessings he brought.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚ú® The Miraculous Opening of the Chest</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was about four years old, while playing with Halima's son near their tents, a remarkable miracle occurred. Two angels (believed to be Jibril and Mikail) appeared in the form of men dressed in white. They took the young Muhammad, laid him down gently, opened his chest without causing any pain, and removed his heart. They washed it with Zamzam water in a golden basin, removed a dark clot (representing any possibility of sin or Satan's influence), and then filled his heart with faith, wisdom, and light before returning it to his chest, which healed without leaving any trace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Halima's son witnessed this miracle and ran to tell his mother. When Halima found Muhammad, he was standing up, slightly pale but unharmed. Fearing for his safety and realizing this child was extraordinary, Halima decided to return him to his mother in Mecca. This miraculous event was the first of many that would prepare him for his prophetic mission, purifying his heart from any possibility of error or sin.

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah Ô∑∫ said, 'I was distinguished from other prophets by six things: I was given comprehensive words, I was aided by awe, spoils were made lawful for me, the earth was made a place of prayer and purification for me, I was sent to all of creation, and the prophetic line was sealed with me.'"

                <h3>üíî Death of His Mother</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was six years old, his mother Aminah decided to visit his father's grave in Yathrib and to visit her relatives from Banu Najjar. She took young Muhammad and their freed slave woman Umm Ayman (Barakah) on this journey. They stayed in Yathrib for a month, during which Aminah told her son about his father and the family connections there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the return journey to Mecca, Aminah fell seriously ill at a place called Abwa, between Yathrib and Mecca. She died there, leaving six-year-old Muhammad Ô∑∫ completely orphaned. Umm Ayman buried Aminah at Abwa and brought Muhammad back to Mecca, where his grandfather Abdul Muttalib took custody of him. This was another divinely decreed trial that shaped the character of the future Prophet, teaching him compassion for the lonely and bereaved.

                <h3>üë¥ Under His Grandfather's Care</h3>
                <p>
                    Abdul Muttalib, Muhammad's grandfather and the leader of Mecca, took him under his special care. Despite having many children and grandchildren, Abdul Muttalib treated Muhammad with exceptional love and attention. He would have his special carpet spread beside the Kaaba, and while no one else dared to sit on it, he would allow young Muhammad to sit with him, saying: "Let my son be, for by Allah, he will have a great future."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abdul Muttalib recognized the special qualities in his grandson - his intelligence, honesty, and the dignity that seemed beyond his years. He would take Muhammad with him to the assemblies of Meccan nobles, and people were amazed by the child's wisdom and good manners. Abdul Muttalib would say: "This son of mine will surely attain great dignity." For two years, Muhammad enjoyed the loving care of his grandfather, learning about leadership, tribal politics, and the management of the sacred Kaaba.

                <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Guardianship of Abu Talib</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was eight years old, his grandfather Abdul Muttalib died, but not before entrusting Muhammad to the care of his son Abu Talib (Muhammad's uncle). In his final moments, Abdul Muttalib called Abu Talib and said: "Take care of this orphan, for his father died while his mother was pregnant with him, and his mother died while he was still young. I have never seen anyone from our family who will attain the honor that this child will attain. Take care of him and be like a father to him."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abu Talib, despite having limited means compared to other Meccan nobles, took exceptional care of Muhammad. He treated him better than his own sons, always ensuring Muhammad had the best food and clothing. Abu Talib's wife, Fatima bint Asad, also treated Muhammad like her own son, nursing him and caring for him with tremendous love. The Prophet Ô∑∫ later said about her: "She was like a mother to me after my mother died."

                <h3>üê™ First Journey to Syria</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was twelve years old, Abu Talib decided to take him on a trading caravan to Syria. Initially, Abu Talib planned to leave Muhammad behind, but the boy's eagerness to accompany his uncle, combined with Abu Talib's love for him, led to Muhammad being included in the journey. This was Muhammad's first journey outside the Arabian Peninsula, and it would prove to be significant in many ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The caravan route passed through many towns and villages, giving young Muhammad exposure to different cultures, languages, and ways of life. He observed the trading practices, the treatment of people, and the various religious communities they encountered. This journey was part of his preparation for his future role as a messenger to all nations, giving him firsthand knowledge of the world beyond Mecca.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚õ™ The Monk Bahira's Recognition</h3>
                <p>
                    During this Syrian journey, when the caravan stopped at Busra (in present-day southern Jordan), they encountered a Christian monk named Bahira (originally named Jirjis). Bahira lived in a monastery and was known for his knowledge of previous scriptures. Usually, he paid no attention to passing caravans, but this time he came out of his monastery and invited the entire caravan for a meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bahira had noticed a cloud that seemed to follow and shade one particular member of the caravan - young Muhammad. When he saw Muhammad, Bahira examined him carefully and found the physical signs mentioned in Christian and Jewish scriptures about the coming final prophet: the seal of prophethood between his shoulder blades, his facial features, and his general demeanor. Bahira told Abu Talib: "Take your nephew back to his homeland quickly and guard him carefully from the Jews, for by Allah, if they see him and recognize what I have recognized, they will try to harm him. Great things await this nephew of yours."
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üíº Youth and Character Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As Muhammad Ô∑∫ grew into adolescence and young adulthood, he became known throughout Mecca for his exceptional character. Even before his prophetic mission, he was given the title "As-Sadiq Al-Amin" (The Truthful and Trustworthy). He never lied, never broke a promise, and never betrayed anyone's trust. People would deposit their valuables with him for safekeeping, knowing they would be completely secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike many young men of his time, Muhammad never participated in the drinking, gambling, or immoral activities that were common in pre-Islamic Arabian society. He was naturally inclined toward worship and contemplation, often spending time in solitude reflecting on the meaning of life and the nature of existence. His character was so exemplary that even his enemies, after he began preaching Islam, never questioned his personal integrity or honesty.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚öîÔ∏è The Fijar Wars and Peace-making</h3>
                <p>
                    During Muhammad's youth, several conflicts erupted between different Arab tribes, known as the Fijar Wars (forbidden wars, so called because they occurred during the sacred months when fighting was traditionally prohibited). Muhammad Ô∑∫ participated in some of these conflicts alongside his uncles, but his role was mainly defensive - protecting his family and tribe rather than engaging in aggression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More significantly, Muhammad participated in the "Hilf al-Fudul" (Alliance of the Virtuous), a pact formed by several Meccan tribes to protect the oppressed and ensure justice for those who were wronged, regardless of their tribal affiliation. This alliance was formed to help anyone who was treated unjustly in Mecca, whether they were locals or visitors. Even after receiving his prophetic mission, Muhammad Ô∑∫ spoke positively of this alliance, saying: "I witnessed an alliance in the house of Abdullah ibn Jud'an that was so excellent that I would not exchange my participation in it for a herd of red camels, and if I were called to it now in Islam, I would respond."

                <h3>üí∞ Working for Khadijah</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was twenty-five years old, he was hired by Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, a wealthy and noble widow who was one of Mecca's most successful merchants. Khadijah had heard about Muhammad's reputation for honesty and trustworthiness, and she needed someone reliable to manage her trading caravan to Syria. She offered him a higher wage than she had ever paid anyone before, recognizing his exceptional qualities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muhammad accepted this employment and set out for Syria with Khadijah's caravan, accompanied by her slave Maysarah, who would later report back to Khadijah about Muhammad's conduct. Throughout the journey, Maysarah observed Muhammad's excellent character, his fair dealing with customers, his honesty in all transactions, and several miraculous incidents: unusual profits from the trade, strange phenomena like being shaded by clouds, and the respect he commanded from everyone who met him.

                <h3>üíí Marriage to Khadijah</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad returned from Syria, Maysarah told Khadijah about everything he had witnessed. The trading venture had been extraordinarily successful, earning double the usual profits. More importantly, Maysarah described Muhammad's character, integrity, and the remarkable events he had witnessed. Khadijah, who was forty years old and had been pursued by many wealthy and powerful men whom she had refused, found herself drawn to Muhammad's character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Khadijah sent her friend Nafisa bint Munyah to approach Muhammad indirectly about the possibility of marriage. When the subject was broached, Muhammad consulted with his uncle Abu Talib, who was delighted with the proposal. The marriage was arranged, and Muhammad Ô∑∫ married Khadijah in a beautiful ceremony attended by the nobles of Mecca. This marriage would prove to be one of the most blessed unions in history, providing Muhammad with emotional support, financial security, and a loving partner who would become the first person to believe in his prophetic mission.

                <p>
                    Muhammad Ô∑∫ and Khadijah were blessed with six children. Their sons were Al-Qasim (by whose name Muhammad was known as Abu al-Qasim), and Abdullah (also called At-Tayyib and At-Tahir). Both sons died in infancy, which was a source of great sadness but also part of Allah's preparation of His messenger for empathy with all parents who lose children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their four daughters were Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum, and Fatimah. All four daughters lived to adulthood, married, and except for Fatimah, predeceased their father. Fatimah would become particularly close to her father and would be the mother of his beloved grandsons Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn through her marriage to Ali ibn Abi Talib. The family life was harmonious and filled with love, providing Muhammad Ô∑∫ with the emotional stability that would support him through the challenges of his prophetic mission.

                <h3>üèóÔ∏è Participation in Rebuilding the Kaaba</h3>
                <p>
                    When Muhammad Ô∑∫ was thirty-five years old, the Kaaba needed to be rebuilt due to damage from floods. The various tribes of Mecca cooperated in the reconstruction, but when it came time to place the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) in its position, a serious dispute arose. Each tribe wanted the honor of placing the sacred stone, and the conflict threatened to lead to warfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dispute continued for several days until the tribes agreed to accept the judgment of the first person to enter the sanctuary the next morning. That person was Muhammad Ô∑∫. When they saw him, they exclaimed: "This is Al-Amin (the trustworthy one). We are pleased with him. This is Muhammad." He listened to their problem and came up with a wise solution: he placed the Black Stone on a cloak and asked representatives from each major tribe to hold the corners of the cloak and lift it together. When the stone reached the appropriate height, Muhammad himself placed it in its designated position. This incident demonstrated his wisdom and his role as a natural mediator and problem-solver.

                <p>
                    As Muhammad Ô∑∫ approached his fortieth year, he began spending increasing amounts of time in spiritual contemplation and meditation. He was troubled by the idol worship, social injustices, and moral corruption that surrounded him in Meccan society. He would often retreat to the cave of Hira, located in a mountain called Jabal an-Nur (Mountain of Light) about three miles from Mecca.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this cave, Muhammad would spend days and nights in worship and reflection, contemplating the creation of the heavens and the earth, and searching for truth and meaning. He would worship Allah according to the monotheistic tradition of his ancestor Ibrahim (Abraham), rejecting the polytheism of his people. Khadijah would often send food with him or bring it herself, supporting his spiritual journey. These periods of spiritual preparation were divinely ordained to ready him for the momentous responsibility of prophethood that was about to be bestowed upon him.
