                <h3>üì¢ The Divine Command to Preach Publicly</h3>
                <p>
                    After three years of private preaching that had seen the formation of a small but devoted group of Muslims, Allah commanded His messenger to begin the public call to Islam. This command came in the revelation: "And warn your closest relatives" (Quran 26:214). This directive marked a decisive turning point in Prophet Muhammad's Ô∑∫ prophetic mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transition from private to public preaching represented a significant escalation in the mission. It meant that Islam was no longer a private matter confined to a small circle, but a message intended for all humanity. This transition required courage and determination, as the Prophet Ô∑∫ knew it would provoke serious opposition from the Meccan establishment.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "And warn your closest relatives. And lower your wing to those of the believers who follow you."
                <div class="source">Quran 26:214-215</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üèîÔ∏è The Call from Mount Safa</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the divine command, the Prophet Ô∑∫ climbed Mount Safa, one of the small hills near the Kaaba, and called out to the various tribes of Quraysh: "O people of Quraysh!" When they gathered, he asked them: "If I were to tell you that there is an army behind this hill ready to attack you, would you believe me?" They replied unanimously: "Yes, we have never heard you lie."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the Prophet Ô∑∫ declared: "I am a warner to you before a severe punishment comes." He then proclaimed: "O sons of Abd al-Muttalib, O sons of Abd Manaf, O sons of Zuhrah, O sons of Taym, O sons of Makhzum, O sons of Asad, O sons of Abd al-Dar, O sons of Sahm, O sons of Jumah, O sons of Adi, O sons of Ka'b, save yourselves from the Fire! I cannot avail you anything against Allah. You have kinship with me, and I will maintain it, but save yourselves from the Fire!"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üò§ Abu Lahab's Immediate Opposition</h3>
                <p>
                    As soon as the Prophet Ô∑∫ finished his declaration, his uncle Abu Lahab (Abd al-Uzza ibn Abd al-Muttalib) stood up in anger and shouted: "May you perish! Did you gather us for this?" This was the first public rejection of the Islamic message, and it came from within the Prophet's own family, demonstrating how the message would divide even the closest relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abu Lahab's hostile reaction was immediately followed by the revelation of Surah Al-Masad (Chapter 111): "May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he. His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained. He will burn in a Fire of [blazing] flame, And his wife [as well] - the carrier of firewood. Around her neck is a rope of [twisted] fiber." This surah publicly condemned Abu Lahab and his wife for their opposition to Islam.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üèõÔ∏è Preaching at the Kaaba</h3>
                <p>
                    After this initial public declaration, the Prophet Ô∑∫ began regularly preaching near the Kaaba during the pilgrimage seasons and market days when Mecca was filled with visitors from all over Arabia. He would stand near the sacred sanctuary and call people to worship Allah alone, abandon idolatry, believe in the Day of Judgment, and follow his message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫'s preaching was eloquent and powerful. He would recite verses from the Quran, which amazed listeners with their beauty, depth, and spiritual impact. Many who heard the Quranic recitation, even enemies of Islam, were moved by its majesty and could not deny its extraordinary nature, though they stubbornly refused to accept its divine origin due to pride and tribal loyalties.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "The Messenger of Allah Ô∑∫ used to recite the Quran to the people during the pilgrimage season, saying: 'O people, say La ilaha illa Allah and you will succeed.'"
                <div class="source">Musnad Ahmad</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üë• The Growing Muslim Community</h3>
                <p>
                    With the beginning of public preaching, more people began to accept Islam. The new converts came from various social backgrounds: some were wealthy merchants like Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, others were slaves like Bilal ibn Rabah and Ammar ibn Yasir, and still others were young people from different tribes who were attracted to the message of monotheism and social justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The growing Muslim community developed a strong sense of brotherhood and mutual support. They would gather secretly in the house of Al-Arqam ibn Abi Al-Arqam, located near Mount Safa, to listen to the Prophet's Ô∑∫ teachings, perform prayers together, and strengthen their faith. This house became the first Islamic center and the headquarters of the early Muslim community in Mecca.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚öîÔ∏è Escalating Opposition from Quraysh</h3>
                <p>
                    As Islam gained more followers, the opposition from the Quraysh intensified dramatically. The tribal leaders realized that Muhammad's Ô∑∫ message posed a direct threat to their economic interests (the pilgrimage business centered around idol worship), their social status (the new religion preached equality), and their religious traditions (it called for abandoning ancestral beliefs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Quraysh began using various tactics to stop the spread of Islam: they spread lies and rumors about the Prophet Ô∑∫, calling him a madman, sorcerer, or poet; they attempted to bribe him with wealth and power; they put social and economic pressure on new converts; and they began physically harassing and torturing Muslims, especially those from weaker social backgrounds who had no tribal protection.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üó£Ô∏è Accusations Against the Prophet</h3>
                <p>
                    Unable to refute the logical arguments and spiritual power of the Quranic message, the Quraysh resorted to personal attacks against the Prophet Ô∑∫. They accused him of being "majnun" (possessed by jinn), "sahir" (sorcerer), "kahin" (soothsayer), and "sha'ir" (poet). Each accusation was designed to discredit him and turn people away from his message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, these accusations were inconsistent and contradictory. The people of Mecca knew Muhammad Ô∑∫ for forty years before his prophethood as the most honest, trustworthy, and mentally sound person among them. The very fact that they had to resort to such desperate accusations actually testified to the strength and authenticity of his message and character.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "And they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, 'This is a magician and a liar.'"
                <div class="source">Quran 38:4</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üí∞ Attempts to Bribe the Prophet</h3>
                <p>
                    When accusations failed to stop the Prophet Ô∑∫, the Quraysh tried a different approach: bribery. They sent Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, one of their most eloquent speakers, to make the Prophet Ô∑∫ an offer he couldn't refuse. Utbah said: "O my nephew, if you want wealth, we will gather wealth for you until you become the richest among us. If you want honor, we will make you our leader. If you want kingship, we will make you our king. If what comes to you is a spirit that you cannot rid yourself of, we will find you a physician and spend on your treatment until you are cured."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ listened patiently to Utbah's offer, then asked: "Have you finished, O Abu al-Walid?" When Utbah confirmed, the Prophet Ô∑∫ said: "Now listen to me," and recited the opening verses of Surah Fussilat (Chapter 41). The power and beauty of the Quranic recitation so moved Utbah that he returned to the Quraysh leaders and said: "I have heard words unlike anything I have ever heard before. By Allah, it is neither poetry, nor sorcery, nor soothsaying."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üìä The Challenge of the Quran</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Quraysh continued to accuse the Prophet Ô∑∫ of composing the Quran himself, Allah revealed verses challenging them to produce something similar if they truly believed it was human composition. The challenge came in stages: first to produce a book like the Quran, then ten chapters, and finally even a single chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite their pride in Arabic eloquence and poetry, and despite having the strongest motivation to discredit the Quran, the Arabs were completely unable to meet this challenge. This inability was particularly significant because Arabic literature was at its peak during this period, and the Arabs were renowned throughout the world for their linguistic skills and poetic talents.
                </p>

                <h3>ü§ù The Early Converts and Their Sacrifices</h3>
                <p>
                    During this period of public preaching, many notable personalities accepted Islam, each bringing their own sacrifices and contributions to the growing community. Among them were Uthman ibn Affan, who would later become the third Caliph; Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, the Prophet's cousin and brave warrior; and many others who left comfortable lives to follow the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new converts faced immediate challenges: social ostracism from their families and tribes, economic boycotts that threatened their livelihoods, and in many cases, physical persecution. Despite these hardships, their numbers continued to grow, attracted by the message's emphasis on monotheism, social justice, moral purification, and the promise of eternal life with Allah.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Abu Bakr said: 'When the Prophet Ô∑∫ was commanded to preach publicly, he stood up and said: O people, I am Allah's Messenger to you all. Worship Allah, associate nothing with Him, and believe in what I have brought to you.'"

                <h3>üè† The House of Al-Arqam - Early Islamic Center</h3>
                <p>
                    Al-Arqam ibn Abi Al-Arqam, a young man from the Makhzum tribe, offered his house as a meeting place for the Muslims. Located at the foot of Mount Safa, this house became the first Islamic center where Muslims gathered to learn about their religion, perform prayers, and plan their activities. The choice of Al-Arqam's house was strategic, as it was from a different tribe than the Prophet Ô∑∫, making it less suspicious to the Quraysh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this house, the foundations of Islamic worship and community life were established. Muslims learned the proper way to perform ablution and prayer, memorized Quranic verses, received religious instruction from the Prophet Ô∑∫, and developed the strong bonds of brotherhood that would sustain them through the difficult times ahead. It was here that many of the most important early conversions took place, including those of Umar ibn al-Khattab and others.

                <h3>üìñ Revelation and Its Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    During this period of public preaching, the Quranic revelations continued to address the new challenges facing the Muslim community. Many surahs revealed during this time dealt with the arguments of the polytheists, provided comfort and encouragement to the believers, and established fundamental Islamic beliefs and practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact of these revelations was profound, both on believers and non-believers. Muslims found in them guidance for every aspect of life and spiritual strength to endure persecution. Even opponents of Islam were often moved by the Quran's eloquence and spiritual power, though most refused to abandon their ancestral beliefs due to pride, economic interests, or fear of social consequences.
