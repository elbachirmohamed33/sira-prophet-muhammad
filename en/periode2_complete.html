                <h3>🌟 The Blessed Night of Power - Ramadan 610 CE</h3>
                <p>
                    On a blessed night during the month of Ramadan in 610 CE, when Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was forty years old, the most significant event in human history occurred. While he was in contemplative worship in the Cave of Hira, away from the noise and idolatry of Mecca, the Angel Gabriel (Jibril) descended with the first verses of the Noble Quran, announcing the beginning of the final message to humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet ﷺ had made it his custom to retreat to this cave for an entire month each year, engaging in spiritual contemplation and worship according to the monotheistic tradition of Abraham. He would take provisions with him for several nights, then return to his beloved wife Khadijah to resupply before returning again to his spiritual retreat.

                <h3>👤 Khadijah the Great - The First Believer</h3>
                <p>
                    When the Prophet ﷺ returned home from Cave Hira, he was deeply moved by what he had experienced. He entered his home and said to his beloved wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid: "Cover me, cover me!" She wrapped him until his fear subsided. Then he told her what had happened and said, "I fear for myself."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Khadijah's words served as healing balm and strong support for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ during those crucial moments. With her wisdom, faith, and complete trust in her husband, she strengthened and supported him, becoming the first person to believe in his message and confirm his prophethood.

                <p>
                    Khadijah took her husband to her elderly cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who was a learned man well-versed in the scriptures. He had embraced Christianity during the pre-Islamic period and could read Hebrew and Aramaic. He had extensive knowledge of both the Torah and the Gospel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Waraqah heard the Prophet's account, he immediately recognized the significance of what had occurred. He said: "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (Angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live to see when your people would turn you out." The Prophet asked in surprise: "Will they drive me out?" Waraqah replied: "Yes, anyone who has brought something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility."

                <h3>⏳ The Pause in Revelation (Fatrat al-Wahy)</h3>
                <p>
                    After the initial revelation from Surah Al-Alaq, there was a period when no revelation came down, known as "Fatrat al-Wahy" (the pause in revelation). Scholars differ about its duration - some say it lasted days, others months. During this period, the Prophet ﷺ experienced great sorrow and longed to meet Gabriel again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This pause was divine wisdom that prepared the Prophet ﷺ psychologically and spiritually for the great mission ahead. It taught him patience and waiting, and made him yearn more for revelation and appreciate the blessing of divine communication. The silence ended with the revelation of Surah Al-Muddathir.

                <h3>🏠 Dar al-Arqam - Center of Secret Preaching</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet ﷺ established Dar al-Arqam (the house of al-Arqam ibn Abi al-Arqam) as the center for the secret preaching during this phase. This house was located near Mount Safa, in a quiet place away from the prying eyes of the Quraysh. There, the early believers would gather to learn the teachings of the new religion and receive instruction from the Prophet ﷺ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Al-Arqam's house was chosen because he belonged to Banu Makhzum, who were enemies of Banu Hashim, so the Quraysh did not expect the center of the new faith to be in the house of someone from Banu Makhzum. Additionally, al-Arqam was a young man who had not yet become famous, so attention was not focused on him.

                <p>
                    The secret beginning of the invitation was profound divine wisdom for several reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building a solid core:</strong> Forming a strong and cohesive group of believers before facing intense opposition</li>
                    <li><strong>Establishing faith:</strong> Providing time to establish the foundations of faith in the hearts of early believers</li>
                    <li><strong>Spiritual training:</strong> Training believers in patience, steadfastness, and discretion</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual wisdom:</strong> Gradual progression in invitation from closest to furthest relatives</li>
                    <li><strong>Character building:</strong> Developing the moral and spiritual character of the early community</li>
                    <li><strong>Divine preparation:</strong> Preparing the Prophet ﷺ for the challenges ahead</li>

                <h3>🌅 End of the Secret Phase</h3>
                <p>
                    This secret phase continued for approximately three years (610-613 CE), until Allah revealed: "And warn your closest kindred" (26:214), which marked the beginning of a new phase of public preaching. During these three years, a strong core of believers was formed, numbering around forty men and women who would become the foundation of the Islamic community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transition from secret to public preaching was gradual and divinely guided. The early believers had been spiritually prepared and emotionally strengthened to face the opposition that would come with public declaration of their faith. This period laid the groundwork for all future developments in Islamic history.
