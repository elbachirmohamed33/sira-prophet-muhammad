      <h2>The Night of Destiny</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> 27 Ramadan 610 CE (40 years old)</p>
      <p><strong>Place:</strong> Cave of Hirâ' (Mount Nour)</p>
      <p><strong>What he experienced before the revelation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spent entire nights meditating</li>
        <li>Frequently dreamed of truths that came true</li>
        <li>Hated the idolatrous practices of his people</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>The moving scene:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The angel Jibrîl suddenly appeared in human form</li>
        <li>Embraced him strongly three times</li>
        <li>Ordered him "Read!" although he could not read</li>
        <li>The first verses emerged like a light</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>His human reaction:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ran home trembling, asked Khadija: "Cover me!"</li>
        <li>Feared he had become a poet or possessed</li>
        <li>Confided in his cousin Waraqa: "I fear for my life"</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why it speaks to us:</strong> This scene shows that even God's great chosen ones know fear and doubt. Revelation is a burden before it is an honor.</p>

      <h2>Khadija, First Refuge</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 610 CE</p>
      <p><strong>Place:</strong> Their home in Makkah</p>
      <p><strong>Her unconditional support:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wrapped him in a cloak to calm him</li>
        <li>First to believe in him: "Allah will never abandon you"</li>
        <li>Consulted her Christian cousin Waraqa to reassure him</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Touching words:</strong> "I would be ready to die for you" (reported by 'Aisha)</p>
      <p><strong>Lesson of love:</strong> Behind every great man is an exceptional woman. The Prophet mourned her memory until his own death.</p>
