                <h3>üåô The Divine Permission</h3>
                <p>
                    After the successful Second Pledge of Aqaba and the invitation from the Ansar of Medina, the Prophet Ô∑∫ waited for Allah's permission to emigrate. The revelation came with the verses: "And it is He who will surely cause you to return to a place of return" (Quran 28:85), giving the Prophet Ô∑∫ the divine sanction to leave Mecca and establish the Muslim community in Medina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The permission for Hijra was not just a personal command to the Prophet Ô∑∫ but a turning point in Islamic history. It marked the transition from the period of endurance and patience in Mecca to the phase of building an Islamic society and state. The Hijra would become the beginning of the Islamic calendar, recognizing its fundamental importance in the development of the Muslim community.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Muslims Begin to Emigrate</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the divine permission, the Prophet Ô∑∫ instructed his companions to begin emigrating to Medina in small groups to avoid attracting the attention of the Quraysh. The emigration began gradually, with individual Muslims and families leaving Mecca secretly over several weeks. This careful approach was necessary because the Quraysh had become aware of the Muslims' plans and were determined to prevent the emigration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the first to emigrate were Abu Salama and his wife Umm Salama, though they faced severe obstacles from her family. Other early emigrants included Bilal ibn Rabah, Ammar ibn Yasir, and many of the most persecuted Muslims who had the most to gain from finding safety in Medina. Each departure represented both a personal sacrifice and a strategic move toward establishing the new Muslim community.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "Those who emigrated in Allah's cause after being wronged - We will surely settle them in this world in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if only they could know."
                <div class="source">Quran 16:41</div>
            </quran-verse>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üèõÔ∏è The Quraysh Conspiracy</h3>
                <p>
                    As more Muslims successfully emigrated to Medina, the Quraysh leaders became increasingly alarmed. They realized that if Muhammad Ô∑∫ himself reached Medina and united with the Ansar, he would pose a serious threat to their economic interests and political dominance. They convened in the Dar al-Nadwa (Council House) to devise a plan to prevent the Prophet's emigration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After much deliberation, they devised what they thought was a foolproof plan: they would select one young man from each tribe to simultaneously strike Muhammad Ô∑∫ with their swords, thus distributing the responsibility for his death among all the tribes and making it impossible for Banu Hashim to seek revenge against any single tribe. This collective assassination plot represented the most serious threat to the Prophet's Ô∑∫ life since the beginning of his mission.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Divine Protection and Warning</h3>
                <p>
                    Allah informed the Prophet Ô∑∫ of the Quraysh assassination plot through revelation, instructing him to leave Mecca immediately and not to sleep in his usual bed that night. The divine warning came just in time, as the conspirators had already positioned themselves around the Prophet's house, waiting for him to emerge in the morning so they could carry out their plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ arranged for Ali ibn Abi Talib to sleep in his bed, covered with his green cloak, to create the impression that he was still in the house. Ali courageously accepted this dangerous assignment, knowing that he might be killed if the deception was discovered. This act of loyalty and sacrifice by Ali demonstrated the depth of devotion the Prophet's companions had for him and his mission.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üö™ The Miraculous Departure</h3>
                <p>
                    On the night of the assassination attempt, the Prophet Ô∑∫ left his house by divine protection. According to historical accounts, he passed directly among the sleeping conspirators without being detected, even throwing dust on their heads while reciting verses from Surah Ya-Sin: "And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see" (36:9).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ went to Abu Bakr's house, where he found his loyal friend ready and waiting. Abu Bakr had been preparing for this journey for weeks, having two camels fed and ready for the arduous trip to Medina. When the Prophet Ô∑∫ arrived and announced that Allah had given permission for the Hijra, Abu Bakr wept tears of joy and immediately offered to accompany his beloved friend on this historic journey.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Abu Bakr said: 'By my father and mother, O Messenger of Allah! These are my two camels which I have been keeping ready for this purpose.' And the Prophet Ô∑∫ said: 'I will take them for a price.'"
                <div class="source">Sahih al-Bukhari</div>
            </hadith-box>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚õ∞Ô∏è The Cave of Thawr</h3>
                <p>
                    Instead of taking the direct route north to Medina, the Prophet Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr headed south toward the Cave of Thawr, located in a mountain about five kilometers from Mecca. This unexpected route was designed to confuse any pursuers and give them time to escape before the Quraysh discovered their departure. The cave would serve as their hiding place for three crucial days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The journey to the cave was treacherous, involving climbing steep rocky terrain in darkness. Abu Bakr, in his devotion to protecting the Prophet Ô∑∫, would sometimes walk ahead to check for dangers and sometimes behind to watch for pursuers. When they reached the cave, Abu Bakr entered first to ensure it was safe, even blocking holes in the cave wall with pieces of his clothing to protect the Prophet Ô∑∫ from any creatures that might be inside.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üï∑Ô∏è Divine Protection in the Cave</h3>
                <p>
                    During their three days in the cave, Allah provided miraculous protection for the Prophet Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr. A spider wove its web across the cave entrance, and a dove built its nest and laid eggs nearby, creating the appearance that no one had entered the cave recently. These natural phenomena served as divine camouflage, deceiving the Quraysh search parties who came very close to discovering their hiding place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On one occasion, the pursuers came so close to the cave that Abu Bakr could see their feet from inside. Fearing for the Prophet's safety, Abu Bakr whispered his concerns, but the Prophet Ô∑∫ reassured him with the immortal words: "Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us." This moment of complete trust in Allah's protection became one of the most celebrated examples of faith and reliance on divine providence in Islamic history.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üîç The Quraysh Search Efforts</h3>
                <p>
                    When the conspirators discovered that Ali was sleeping in the Prophet's bed instead of Muhammad Ô∑∫ himself, they realized they had been outmaneuvered. The Quraysh immediately launched an intensive search operation, offering a reward of 100 camels for anyone who could bring back Muhammad Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr, dead or alive. Search parties scoured the areas around Mecca, following every possible route to Medina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The search was so thorough that some parties reached the very mouth of the Cave of Thawr. However, when they saw the spider's web and the dove's nest, they concluded that no one could have entered the cave recently without disturbing these natural formations. Divine providence thus used the simplest of Allah's creatures to protect His messenger from the most determined human enemies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "If you do not aid the Prophet - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Mecca] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, 'Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us.'"
                <div class="source">Quran 9:40</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üì° The Intelligence Network</h3>
                <p>
                    During their stay in the cave, Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, Abu Bakr's son, served as their intelligence agent, visiting Mecca during the day to gather information about the search efforts and then secretly reporting to them in the cave at night. Asma bint Abi Bakr, Abu Bakr's daughter, brought them food and water, while Amir ibn Fuhayra, Abu Bakr's shepherd, would graze his flock near the cave to provide cover and eliminate tracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This carefully organized support network demonstrated the loyalty and dedication of the Prophet's companions and Abu Bakr's family. Each person played a crucial role in ensuring the success of the Hijra, risking their own safety to protect the Prophet Ô∑∫ and preserve the future of Islam. Their coordinated efforts showed the strong bonds of brotherhood and shared commitment that characterized the early Muslim community.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üê™ The Journey Resumes</h3>
                <p>
                    After three days in the cave, when the intensity of the search had diminished, Abdullah ibn Urayqit, a skilled guide from the Dil tribe (who was not yet Muslim but was trusted by Abu Bakr), arrived with the camels and supplies for the journey to Medina. The guide had been hired weeks earlier and had kept the camels in a secret location, ready for this moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The party set out on an indirect route along the Red Sea coast, avoiding the main roads where Quraysh search parties might still be active. The journey was arduous, covering approximately 400 kilometers through desert terrain under the scorching Arabian sun. Abu Bakr's camel was shared between him and the guide, while the Prophet Ô∑∫ rode his camel, which was later named al-Qaswa.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚öîÔ∏è The Encounter with Suraqah</h3>
                <p>
                    During the journey, the travelers were pursued by Suraqah ibn Malik, a skilled tracker who had heard about the reward for capturing the Prophet Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr. Suraqah followed their tracks and came close enough to pose a serious threat. However, when he got near the Prophet's party, his horse stumbled and threw him to the ground three times, which he interpreted as a divine sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Realizing that he was fighting against Allah's will, Suraqah called out to the Prophet Ô∑∫, asking for security and promising not to harm them. The Prophet Ô∑∫ granted him safety and even prophesied that one day Suraqah would wear the bracelets of the Persian emperor Khosrow. This prophecy came true years later during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab, and Suraqah eventually converted to Islam.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Suraqah said: 'I asked the Prophet Ô∑∫ to write me a guarantee of safety, so he instructed Amir ibn Fuhayra to write it on a piece of leather or a shoulder blade, and then he gave it to me.'"

                <h3>üèòÔ∏è Arrival in Quba</h3>
                <p>
                    After an exhausting journey of several days, the Prophet Ô∑∫ and Abu Bakr finally reached Quba, a settlement on the outskirts of Medina, on Monday, the 12th of Rabi' al-Awwal (September 23, 622 CE). They were warmly welcomed by the Muslims of Quba, particularly Kulthoum ibn al-Hidm, who hosted the Prophet Ô∑∫ in his home. This was the first safe haven they had reached since leaving Mecca.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his four-day stay in Quba, the Prophet Ô∑∫ established the first mosque ever built by him - Masjid Quba. This mosque holds special significance in Islamic history as the first place of worship constructed under the Prophet's direct supervision. The Prophet Ô∑∫ participated in its construction with his own hands, carrying stones and working alongside his companions, setting an example of humility and community participation.
                </p>

                <h3>üê™ The Entry into Medina</h3>
                <p>
                    On Friday, the 16th of Rabi' al-Awwal, the Prophet Ô∑∫ set out from Quba for the final stage of his journey to Medina. Ali ibn Abi Talib, who had safely completed his mission in Mecca and returned the trusts that people had left with the Prophet Ô∑∫, joined the party along the way. The procession that entered Medina was a moment of historic triumph and joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire population of Medina - men, women, and children - came out to welcome the Prophet Ô∑∫. The streets were filled with celebrations, with people singing welcoming songs and expressing their joy at his safe arrival. Young girls sang the famous welcoming song: "The full moon has risen over us from the valley of Wada, and we owe it to thank Allah as long as anyone calls upon Allah."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üè† Choosing a Residence</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Prophet Ô∑∫ proceeded through Medina on his camel, many prominent families invited him to stay with them, each hoping for the honor of hosting Allah's messenger. However, the Prophet Ô∑∫ wisely said: "Let the camel go its way, for it is guided by Allah's command." The camel eventually stopped at a plot of land belonging to two orphan boys, Sahl and Suhail, where dates were dried and stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This location, chosen by divine guidance rather than human preference, became the site of the Prophet's mosque and residence. Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, whose house was closest to this location, had the honor of hosting the Prophet Ô∑∫ until his mosque and living quarters could be constructed. The Prophet Ô∑∫ stayed in the upper room of Abu Ayyub's house, while Abu Ayyub and his family moved to the lower floor, considering it inappropriate to be above the Prophet Ô∑∫.
