            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>ü¶Å Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib - The Lion of Allah</h3>
                <p>
                    Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib Ô∑∫, the uncle of Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫, was one of the most respected and feared personalities in Mecca. Known for his exceptional bravery, impressive physical strength, and noble character, Hamza was an accomplished hunter and formidable warrior. His conversion to Islam marked a decisive turning point in the history of the young Muslim community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hamza was four years older than his nephew Muhammad Ô∑∫, but they had grown up together like brothers, having been nursed by the same wet-nurse, Thuwaiba. This closeness created a special bond between them that would last their entire lives. Before his conversion, Hamza deeply respected Muhammad Ô∑∫ as a person but had not yet embraced Islam, remaining faithful to the traditions of his ancestors.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üò† The Incident with Abu Jahl</h3>
                <p>
                    The event that triggered Hamza's conversion occurred when Abu Jahl encountered the Prophet Ô∑∫ near Mount Safa and insulted him grossly, using offensive language and mockeries about his religion. The Prophet Ô∑∫, true to his patient and noble character, did not respond to Abu Jahl's insults and silently continued on his way, absorbed in his spiritual concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A freed slave woman belonging to Abdullah ibn Jud'an witnessed this humiliating scene. When Hamza returned from his usual hunt in the afternoon, carrying his bow on his shoulder as was his custom, the woman told him in detail what Abu Jahl had done to his nephew. She described how Abu Jahl had insulted Muhammad Ô∑∫, mocked his religion, and humiliated him publicly without anyone intervening.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves."
                <div class="source">Quran 48:29</div>
            </quran-verse>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚öîÔ∏è Hamza's Confrontation</h3>
                <p>
                    Inflamed with anger and indignation, Hamza immediately headed toward the Kaaba where Abu Jahl was sitting in the company of other Quraysh nobles. Without hesitation, Hamza struck Abu Jahl violently with his bow on the head, inflicting a bleeding wound. He then declared before the entire assembly: "You insult Muhammad while I follow his religion! I say what he says! Strike me back if you can!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    This public declaration by Hamza caused a sensation among the Quraysh. Abu Jahl, despite his rage and humiliation, was restrained by his companions who advised him not to escalate the conflict with Hamza, knowing his strength and determination. They realized that attacking Hamza could trigger a tribal war they preferred to avoid. This involuntary restraint by Abu Jahl immediately demonstrated the protective impact of Hamza's conversion.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>ü§≤ The Confirmation of Faith</h3>
                <p>
                    Initially, Hamza's declaration was motivated primarily by tribal pride and defense of family honor rather than by deep religious conviction. However, that night, Hamza reflected at length on his public declaration and its implications. He realized that he had publicly committed himself to a path whose spiritual requirements he needed to fully understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hamza went to see the Prophet Ô∑∫ and asked him to explain Islam in detail. After carefully listening to the teachings, reciting the Quranic revelations, and meditating on their meaning, Hamza sincerely embraced Islam with total conviction. His initial conversion through pride transformed into authentic and deep faith that would make him one of Islam's greatest defenders.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üí™ Immediate Impact on the Community</h3>
                <p>
                    Hamza's conversion had an enormous psychological impact on the Muslim community. For the first time since the beginning of public preaching, Muslims had a physical protector who was respected and feared by all Meccans. Persecution against vulnerable Muslims decreased noticeably, as their oppressors now feared Hamza's reaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hamza immediately used his influence and position to protect persecuted Muslims. He personally intervened in several cases of torture and abuse, forcing persecutors to back down. His presence beside the Prophet Ô∑∫ during public preaching greatly discouraged attempts at interruption or physical aggression against Allah's messenger.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Ibn Abbas Ô∑∫ reported: When Hamza embraced Islam, the Quraysh knew that the Prophet Ô∑∫ had become strong and had a protector, so they ceased some of their actions against him."
                <div class="source">Ibn Hisham in the Sirah</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üìñ Umar ibn al-Khattab Before Islam</h3>
                <p>
                    Umar ibn al-Khattab Ô∑∫ was one of the most influential and respected personalities in Mecca before his conversion to Islam. A member of the Banu Adi tribe, he was known for his exceptional physical strength, sharp intelligence, and firm, decisive character. Umar was also one of the few Meccans who could read and write, which gave him special status in the largely illiterate society of the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before his conversion, Umar was one of Islam's most ardent opponents and Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫. He actively participated in persecutions against Muslims and was known for his virulent hostility toward the new religion. His high social position and influential character made him one of the most formidable obstacles to Islam's spread in Mecca.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üó°Ô∏è The Intention to Assassinate the Prophet</h3>
                <p>
                    One day, exasperated by what he perceived as the growing division of Meccan society because of Islam, Umar made the drastic decision to assassinate Prophet Muhammad Ô∑∫. He sincerely thought that by eliminating the leader of the Islamic movement, he could restore Mecca's traditional unity and end what he considered a source of social troubles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Umar therefore girded his sword and left his house with the firm intention of finding Muhammad Ô∑∫ and killing him. His expression was so determined and menacing that all those who passed him in the streets could see that he intended to commit a grave act. This decision by Umar represented one of the most dangerous moments for the survival of the Prophet Ô∑∫ and his mission.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üõ§Ô∏è The Encounter with Nu'aym ibn Abdullah</h3>
                <p>
                    On his way to his sinister destination, Umar met Nu'aym ibn Abdullah al-Nahham, a man from his tribe who had secretly embraced Islam but had not yet revealed his conversion. Nu'aym, seeing Umar's threatening expression and guessing his intentions, asked him where he was going. Umar frankly replied that he was going to kill Muhammad Ô∑∫ to save the Quraysh from his divisive teachings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nu'aym, in a moment of divine inspiration, used a brilliant psychological tactic. Instead of trying to directly dissuade Umar (which might have aroused his suspicions), he diverted his attention to his own family: "Umar, by Allah, you are gravely mistaken! Do you think the Banu Abd Manaf will let you walk on earth if you kill Muhammad? Should you not rather take care of the people of your own household and correct them?"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "And thus We have made from among you a just community that you will be witnesses over people and the Messenger will be a witness over you."
                <div class="source">Quran 2:143</div>
            </quran-verse>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üè† The Discovery at His Sister's House</h3>
                <p>
                    Intrigued and irritated by Nu'aym's words, Umar asked him what he meant. Nu'aym then revealed that his own sister Fatima bint al-Khattab and his brother-in-law Sa'id ibn Zayd had embraced Islam. This revelation deeply shocked Umar, who had not suspected that Islam had already entered his own family. He immediately changed direction and headed toward his sister's house, boiling with anger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Umar arrived at Fatima's house, he heard voices reciting something he didn't recognize. These were actually Fatima, Sa'id, and their teacher Khabbab ibn al-Aratt reciting Surah Ta-Ha, which had just been revealed. The beauty and majesty of the Quranic recitation unconsciously struck Umar, even in his anger, though he didn't yet understand what it was about.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üí• The Family Confrontation</h3>
                <p>
                    Umar knocked violently on the door and demanded to know what he had heard. Khabbab quickly hid, and Fatima and Sa'id tried to conceal the sheets on which the surah was written. But Umar had clearly heard their voices, and he forced his way into the house, accusing his sister and brother-in-law of abandoning their ancestors' religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sa'id ibn Zayd courageously responded to Umar: "O Umar, what would you say if the truth were in a religion other than yours?" This direct question enraged Umar, and he threw himself at Sa'id to beat him. Fatima intervened to defend her husband, and Umar, in his blind fury, struck her in the face, causing a bleeding wound. This violence against his own sister marked the lowest point of Umar's anger.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚ú® The Moment of Transformation</h3>
                <p>
                    When Umar saw blood flowing from his beloved sister's face, something changed profoundly within him. The sight of his own violence against a family member filled him with shame and instantly calmed him. Fatima, despite her pain, spoke to her brother with dignity and firmness: "Yes, we have become Muslims and we believe in Allah and His messenger. So do what you want!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    This courageous declaration by his sister, spoken despite pain and danger, deeply impressed Umar. He suddenly realized the sincerity and strength of their conviction. Something in their behavior - their courage in the face of danger, their dignity in suffering, and their firmness in their convictions - made him understand that he was facing something deeper than a simple social rebellion.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üìú Reading Surah Ta-Ha</h3>
                <p>
                    Touched by remorse and curious despite himself, Umar asked to see what they were reciting. Fatima, initially hesitant due to his previous anger, finally agreed on condition that he purify himself first. Umar therefore washed his hands and face, then Fatima gave him the sheets containing the verses of Surah Ta-Ha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Umar began to read: "Ta-Ha. We have not sent down to you the Quran that you be distressed, but only as a reminder for those who fear Allah. A revelation from He who created the earth and the lofty heavens..." As he read, Umar was increasingly impressed by the beauty, depth, and spiritual power of these words. He exclaimed: "How beautiful and noble these words are!"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hadith-box">
                "Ibn Abbas Ô∑∫ reported: The Prophet Ô∑∫ said: 'O Allah, strengthen Islam through one of the two Umars: either Umar ibn al-Khattab or Amr ibn Hisham (Abu Jahl).' And it was Umar ibn al-Khattab who was more beloved to Allah."

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üïå The Meeting with the Prophet</h3>
                <p>
                    After reading the surah, Umar asked where he could find Muhammad Ô∑∫. Khabbab, who had come out of hiding, told him that the Prophet Ô∑∫ was in Al-Arqam's house near Mount Safa. Umar immediately headed toward this house, but now with a completely transformed heart. The man who had left to commit murder was now walking toward the truth he had finally recognized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Umar arrived at Al-Arqam's house, he knocked on the door. The Muslims inside, knowing Umar's hostility toward Islam, were alarmed by his presence. Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib looked through a gap and saw Umar with his sword. He said: "Here is Umar with his sword! By Allah, if he comes with good intentions, we will welcome him well, and if he comes with bad intentions, we will kill him with his own sword!"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>ü§ù Accepting Islam</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫, however, had a divine inspiration and said: "Let him enter." When Umar entered, the Prophet Ô∑∫ stood up, took him by his cloak and by his sword strap, and asked him directly: "What brings you, O Umar? I don't think you will cease until Allah sends some calamity upon you!" This direct but firm approach by the Prophet Ô∑∫ deeply impressed Umar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Umar replied with sincerity and humility: "O Messenger of Allah, I have come to believe in Allah and His messenger and in what he has brought from Allah." The Prophet Ô∑∫ immediately pronounced "Allahu Akbar" (Allah is Greatest) with such intense joy that all the Muslims present in the house heard it and rejoiced. This moment marked one of the most significant conversions in Islamic history.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üì¢ Public Prayer at the Kaaba</h3>
                <p>
                    Immediately after his conversion, Umar asked the Prophet Ô∑∫: "O Messenger of Allah, are we not in the truth, whether we are alive or dead?" When the Prophet Ô∑∫ confirmed that yes, Umar said: "Then why do we hide? By Him who sent you with the truth, I will go out and pray publicly!" This declaration immediately showed the transformative impact of Umar's conversion on his personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Umar left Al-Arqam's house with the Muslims organized in two ranks - one led by Hamza and the other by Umar himself. They marched to the Kaaba and prayed there publicly for the first time in the history of Islam in Mecca. This public demonstration of strength terrified the polytheists, who realized that Islam had gained two powerful protectors who would completely change the balance of forces in Mecca.
