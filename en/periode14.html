      <p><strong>Context:</strong> After signing the controversial treaty</p>
      <p><strong>Full text:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        "O people! By Allah, you are the best soldiers on earth, and you have been called to perform the pilgrimage. The polytheists blocked your way, but Allah made this truce an opening to unexpected conquests.
        I swear by the One who holds my soul: They will never wage war against us again without us gaining a greater benefit!"
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> The companions wiped their tears upon hearing this prophecy which came true 2 years later.</p>

      <h2>Letter to Heraclius (7H/629 CE)</h2>
      <p><strong>Material used:</strong> Tanned parchment with silver seal, black ink mixed with musk</p>
      <p><strong>Key content:</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        "In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful...
        To Heraclius, Emperor of the Romans,
        Peace be upon those who follow guidance.
        I call you to Islam. Embrace Islam, you will be safe - Allah will give you double reward. If you refuse, you will bear the sin of your subjects.
        O People of the Book! Come to a common word... (Quran 3:64)"
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Heraclius summoned his generals and read the Gospels: "This man matches the descriptions in our Book"</p>

      <h2>Speech of the Conquest (8H/630 CE)</h2>
      <p><strong>In front of the Kaaba - 20 Ramadan</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        "What do you think I will do to you today?
        (The trembling Quraysh): "You are a noble brother, son of a noble brother..."
        "I say to you as Yusuf said to his brothers: No blame on you today! (Quran 12:92)
        Go, you are free."
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Symbolic acts:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>General pardon except for 4 war criminals</li>
        <li>Destruction of idols quoting: "Truth has come, falsehood has vanished" (Quran 17:81)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Behind every great man is an exceptional woman. The Prophet mourned her memory until his own death.</p>
