                <h3>üåü Birth of the Prophet Ô∑∫ (570 CE)</h3>
                <p>
                    Muhammad Ô∑∫ was born in Mecca in the Year of the Elephant, corresponding to 570 CE. His birth was blessed, though he was born as an orphan, as his father Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib had passed away before his birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His mother was Aminah bint Wahb from the nobility of Quraysh, and he was cared for by his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, the chief of Quraysh and leader of Mecca.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="quran-verse">
                "Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge? And He found you lost and guided [you], And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient."
                <div class="source">Quran 93:6-8</div>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üë∂ Childhood and Nursing</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ was first nursed by Thuwaybah, the freed slave of Abu Lahab, then by Halimah as-Sa'diyyah from Banu Sa'd ibn Bakr. He grew up in the desert of Banu Sa'd, where he acquired eloquence of speech and physical strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He lived with Halimah as-Sa'diyyah for about four years, and this period witnessed many blessings and good fortune in Halimah's household, so much so that she did not want to part with him.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>üíî Orphanhood and Guardianship</h3>
                <p>
                    His mother Aminah bint Wahb passed away when he was six years old, making him an orphan of both parents. Then his grandfather Abd al-Muttalib died when he was eight, and his uncle Abu Talib took guardianship of him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abu Talib was poor, but he loved the Prophet Ô∑∫ dearly and protected and cared for him. This guardianship continued for forty years until Abu Talib's death in the Year of Sorrow.

                <h3>üêë Shepherding and Trade</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ worked as a shepherd for the people of Mecca in his youth, which prepared him for carrying the great message, as shepherding teaches patience, gentleness, and compassion. He said: "Allah did not send any prophet who did not shepherd sheep."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He then worked in trade and traveled with his uncle Abu Talib to Syria when he was twelve years old, where he met the monk Bahira who prophesied his prophethood.

                <h3>üíç Marriage to Khadijah (595 CE)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ worked in Khadijah bint Khuwaylid's trade, and she was impressed by his honesty and truthfulness. Khadijah was a lady from the nobility of Quraysh, a wealthy and wise merchant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ married Khadijah when he was twenty-five years old, and she was forty. This blessed marriage lasted 25 years, and she bore him all his children except Ibrahim.
                </p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>‚öñÔ∏è Wisdom and Justice</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prophet Ô∑∫ was known among his people as As-Sadiq Al-Amin (The Truthful, The Trustworthy), never known for lying or betrayal. He participated in Hilf al-Fudul, an alliance where Quraysh tribes pledged to support the oppressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also arbitrated in the case of placing the Black Stone during the renovation of the Kaaba, where he proposed a wise solution that pleased all tribes and prevented an imminent war.

                <h3>üïå Contemplation in Cave Hira</h3>
                <p>
                    In the final years before his prophethood, the Prophet Ô∑∫ would seclude himself in Cave Hira for contemplation and worship. He would spend days and nights in this cave, reflecting on Allah's creation and pondering the conditions of his people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This period served as spiritual and psychological preparation for the great mission he would be entrusted with. He would see true visions that would come to pass like the break of dawn.
